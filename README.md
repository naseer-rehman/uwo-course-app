# UWO Course App

The purpose of this project is to create an application that can easily generate draft schedules for students. The application will reduce the burden of checking course and time conflicts, among other considerations, from the student so they only need to worry about WHAT courses to enroll in. The application takes care of the rest.

### Important Note

This project will no longer get updated (maybe) since UWO has removed public access to time/location data related to course components. Without this, it is impossible to (legally) continue further with this project.

I wonder if I can scrape information behind an authentication wall for educational purposes... ðŸ¤”
